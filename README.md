# Content SEO Scanner
Javascript tool built with HTML that will allow you to scan a piece of html or text and give an seo score.

## Javascript SEO Scanner
This is a standalone tool, similar to Yoast SEO for Wordpress. Start typing some content into the textarea and it will start giving you a score with some suggested improvements for the keyword you have provided. Implement the suggestions to improve the ability of a post to accurately rank in search engines for the specified keyword.

## Dependencies
The tool is written in javascript using jQuery with TinyMCE as a dependency for the text editor. This makes it easy to modify to fit the needs of other projects using any server side programming language.

## Example
Download the package with the html file to begin testing this out. The style is minimal, so it should be easy to inject this into any project you have. You can find a live example of this running here.  https://yomotherboard.com/seo-content-analyser/
